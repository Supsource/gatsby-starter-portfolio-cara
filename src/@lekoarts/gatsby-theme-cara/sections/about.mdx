## About

> I'm a professional and passionate Frond-End Developer focused on efficiency and constant learning. Courteous and enthusiastic, I am interested in Web Applications and everything in its orbit. I am fascinated by web programming, developing apps, and building websites. I am gaining knowledge and ideas working in this area. I am keen to gain more experience in the field. My goal is to build applications that are scalable and efficient under the hood while providing engaging, pixel-perfect user experiences.
For this reason, I'm looking for a company willing to offer me a placement among its developers. In return, I would offer my full commitment, and be a pleasant and friendly addition to a team. I am, therefore currently looking for a job or an internship as a web developer. I always want to learn more, do more, and be more. I’m also a firm believer that we should never settle. I’m hard-working, super curious, passionate, committed, and also a fast learner! When I'm not in front of a computer screen, I'm probably watching movies, reading books, or crossing off another item on my bucket list.
